Scripts for use on macOS

I'm still very new to shell scripting so all uploaded scripts have been researched and created to further my own knowledge and development. All have been tested on VM's running on my homelab server (edited to remove any username or password that are specific to my requirements). If there is a better way to do what I've tried to do then please contribute to my content.

Scripts found in the Work Scripts (JAMF) folder have been created alongside my companies Mac-Infrastructure team to further my development.
